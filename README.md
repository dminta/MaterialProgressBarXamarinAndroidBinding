## Why MaterialProgressBar?

- Correct tinting across platforms.
- Able to remove the intrinsic padding of framework `ProgressBar`.
- Able to hide the progress background of framework horizontal `ProgressBar`.
- Able to show a determinate circular progress.
- Used as a drop-in replacement for framework `ProgressBar`.

## Binding and sample code
